# Quake-Messenger

The program first scrapes the earthquake data from a trusted source, and then uses Selenium to automate the process of sending messages through the WhatsApp Web interface. With this program, you can stay up-to-date on any seismic activity that may affect you or your loved ones.

The program is easy to use and can be customized to your preferences. You can specify the minimum magnitude and distance threshold for alerts, as well as the frequency of notifications. The notifications include important details such as the location, magnitude, and time of the earthquake.
